find the midpoint (middle node) in a __singly__ linked list, **but**
- no using a counter variable
- no using the size of the list
- only iterate through the list once at maximum

also
- if the length of list is even, there'd be 2 items in the middle, we'll return the first one (the one closer to the list's head)

prerequisite(s):
- singly linked list
- doubly linked list
