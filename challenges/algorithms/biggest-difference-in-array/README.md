Given an integer array, find the maximum difference between two elements in it such that the smaller element appears before the larger element.

e.g.

- input `{ 2, 7, 9, 5, 1, 3, 5 }` will output `7`, because the pair is `{2,9}`, not `{9,1}`
  - because "the smaller element appears before the larger element"

also

- we don't care what the pair is, we just want the difference
